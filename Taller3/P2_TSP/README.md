## Conclusions

1. For the case study 1, the current solution is not optimal but is good enough for practical purposes and can be found in a reasonable amount of time.

1. For the case study 1, By increasing the exponential growth in the number of posibilities the problem becomes significantly harder to solve as the number of cities increases, loading to increased resolution times.
