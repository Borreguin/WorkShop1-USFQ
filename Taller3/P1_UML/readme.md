# General concl for boxplot
Patterns and anomalies found can lead to some conslusions about the dataset and how
1. Boxplot shows how the 8 labor hours explains the significant increase of CO2 ppm at the both sides of the building.The building temperature raises and keep the thermal energy, as well as the sun reaches its peak brilliance at noon, its the point of the average high temperature. 


1. The experiment hour per hour for single-variable shows that the hour correlation just indicates CO2 increase during the day and the deacrese as long as the people leave the building, some atypical values are shown but unsignificant for the analyses. Temperatures values vs hours shows the raising temperatures at 25Â° degrees for each,
