## Conclusions

1. The KMeans and Fuzzy C-means clustering algorithms provide different perspectives on the data. KMeans provides a hard clustering where each data point is assigned to one cluster, resulting in a wider spread of clusters. On the other hand, Fuzzy C-means allows for soft clustering where data points can belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of membership, often resulting in tighter clusters. This difference is clearly visible in the scatter plots.

1. The scatter plots provide a useful way to visualize the results of the clustering algorithms. Each point in the scatter plot represents a single data point (a row in the DataFrame), with its position determined by its index and its variable value. The centroids of each cluster are also plotted, providing a visual representation of the "center" of each cluster. This visualization can help in understanding the distribution of data within each cluster and the differences between clusters.

1. Using Isolation forest give us the posibilitiy of visualize and detect anomalies in cases where there is a high dimensionality in the data.
